🚀Excited to share my latest Vue.js project! 

As Promised As Delivered
 Built a dynamic, user-focused web app with robust features to showcase modern front-end development skills. Here's what I implemented:
 
🔒Authentication & Security: Integrated Navigation Guards for protected routes, secure Signup, Login, Logout, and Auto-Login functionality using browser Local Storage for seamless user sessions.

 🏋Core Features: Developed a Coach Registerer and Requests Poster system, enabling users to register as coaches and post requests effortlessly.

 🎨User Experience: Enhanced UX with UI Filters for dynamic content filtering, a Base Spinner for smooth loading states, and ReturnURL support for intuitive navigation.

 📀Data Persistence: Leveraged Browser Local Storage to securely store user data, ensuring a lightweight and responsive app.

 🛠️Tech Stack: Vue.js, Vue Router, Local Storage, and a clean, modular codebase for scalability.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into Vue.js and build a feature-rich app with a focus on security, usability, and performance. Excited to keep pushing the boundaries of front-end development!
